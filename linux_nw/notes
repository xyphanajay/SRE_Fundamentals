There are two queues. Syn queue and Accept queue. So when you receive an ack, it’s matched against the Syn queue and if it matches, it’s removed from the queue. so tcp_max_syn_backlog comes in picture here. somaxconn comes in the accept queue. Accept queue contains fully established connections. But nowadays, net.core.somaxconn does both queues. So just check more about it

mimic tcp traceroute 
$traceroute -I url

check your routing table
$ip route
